      <center><h3>line segment</h3></center>

      <p>
        a line segment is a piece or part of a line having two endpoints. Unlike
        a line, a line segment has a definite length.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <center><h3>Ray</h3></center>

      <p>
        A line which starts at a point with given coordinates , and goes off in
        a particular direction to infinity, possibly through a second point
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <center><h3>opposite Ray</h3></center>

      <p>
        Opposite rays are the rays which holds the common end point, but moves
        in the opposite direction. So a pair of opposite rays with the common
        end point always moves in the straight line
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <center><h3>convex set</h3></center>

      <p>
        a convex set or a convex region is a subset that intersect every line
        into a single line segment
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <center><h3>angle</h3></center>

      <p>
        an angle can be defined as the figure formed by two rays meeting at a
        common end point.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <center><h3>right angle</h3></center>

      <p>
        A triangle in which one of the interior angles is 90° is called a right
        triangle
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <center><h3>perpendicular</h3></center>

      <p>
        Two distinct lines intersecting each other at 90° or a right angle are
        called perpendicular lines
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <center><h3>congruent angle</h3></center>

      <p>
        Two angles are congruent if they have the same measure. Two circles are
        congruent if they have the same diameter
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <center><h3>adjacent angle</h3></center>

      <p>
        Two angles that have a common side and a common vertex (corner point),
        and dont overlap.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <center><h3>vertically opposite angle</h3></center>

      <p>
        Vertically opposite angles are the angles formed opposite each other
        when two lines intersect.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <center><h3>angle addition postulate</h3></center>

      <p>
        The angle addition postulate states that if a point is within an angle
        and you add the two angles that are made by drawing a line through the
        point that the total will equal the large angle.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <center><h3>supplement postulate</h3></center>

      <p>
        The Supplement Postulate states that if two angles form a linear pair ,
        then they are supplementary . In the figure, ∠ 1 and ∠ 2 are
        supplementary by the Supplement Postulate.
